# Unmutate 4th Generation

This is a breeding puzzle platformer game with realistic genetics and inheritance.

The creatures are called mendels and they're fictional, like their genes, but they're built upon real concepts.

This implementation simulates DNA bases and amino acids and proteins (A little bit of feature creep, but I couldn't help myself).

## Supported platforms
* Linux
* Android
* Web browser (via Emscripten)
